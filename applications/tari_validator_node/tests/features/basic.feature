# FIXME: when spawning VN2 the test is flaky
Feature: Basic scenarios
  @serial
  Scenario: Template registration and invocation in a 2-VN committee
    # Initialize a base node, wallet and miner
    Given a base node BASE
    Given a wallet WALLET connected to base node BASE
    Given a miner MINER connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET

    # Initialize two validator nodes
    Given a validator node VAL_1 connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET
    # Given a validator node VAL_2 connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET

    # The wallet must have some funds before the VN sends transactions
    When miner MINER mines 12 new blocks

    # VN registration
    When validator node VAL_1 sends a registration transaction
    # When validator node VAL_2 sends a registration transaction
    When miner MINER mines 20 new blocks
    Then the validator node VAL_1 is listed as registered
    # Then the validator node VAL_2 is listed as registered

    # Register the "counter" template
    When validator node VAL_1 registers the template "counter"
    When miner MINER mines 20 new blocks
    Then the template "counter" is listed as registered by the validator node VAL_1
    # Then the template "counter" is listed as registered by the validator node VAL_2

    # A file-base CLI account must be created to sign future calls
    When I create a DAN wallet

    # Create a new Counter component
    When I create a component COUNTER_1 of template "counter" on VAL_1 using "new"

    # Increase the counter
    When I invoke on VAL_1 on component COUNTER_1 the method call "increase" with 1 outputs
    # FIXME: the result after increase should be "1", but for some reason the VN do not handle state properly
    When I invoke on VAL_1 on component COUNTER_1 the method call "value" with 1 outputs the result is "0"

    # Uncomment the following lines to stop execution for manual inspection of the nodes
    # When I print the cucumber world
    #Â When I wait 5000 seconds
