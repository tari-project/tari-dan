Feature: Transaction
  @serial
  Scenario: As a validator node I want to process transactions
    # Initialize a base node, wallet and miner
    Given a base node BASE
    Given a wallet WALLET connected to base node BASE
    Given a miner MINER connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET

    # Initialize two validator nodes
    Given a validator node VAL_1 connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET
    Given a validator node VAL_2 connected to base node BASE and wallet WALLET

    # The wallet must have some funds before the VN sends transactions
    When miner MINER mines 12 new blocks

    # VN registration
    When validator node VAL_1 sends a registration transaction
    When validator node VAL_2 sends a registration transaction
    When miner MINER mines 20 new blocks
    Then the validator node VAL_1 is listed as registered
    Then the validator node VAL_2 is listed as registered

    # Register the "counter" template
    When validator node VAL_1 registers the template "counter"
    When miner MINER mines 20 new blocks
    Then the template "counter" is listed as registered by the validator node VAL_1
    Then the template "counter" is listed as registered by the validator node VAL_2

    # Call the constructor in the "counter" template
    When the validator node VAL_1 calls the function "new" with 1 outputs on the template "counter" 

    # Uncomment the following lines to stop execution for manual inspection of the nodes
    # When I print the cucumber world
    #Â When I wait 5000 seconds
