# A sample log configuration file for running in release mode. By default, this configuration splits up log messages to
# three destinations:
#    * Console: For log messages with level INFO and higher
#    * log/indexer/network.log: INFO-level logs related to the comms crate. This file will be quite busy since there
#      are lots of P2P debug messages, and so this traffic is segregated from the application log messages
#    * log/indexer/dan_layer.log: Non-comms related INFO-level messages and higher are logged into this file
#    * log/indexer/other.log: Third-party crates' messages will be logged here at an ERROR level
#
#  See https://docs.rs/log4rs/0.8.3/log4rs/encode/pattern/index.html for deciphering the log pattern. The log format
#  used in this sample configuration prints messages as:
#  timestamp [target] LEVEL message
